# Travelog
April 2017 - September 2019 (2 years 6 months)

Because of the trust built with the customer through a long-term cooperation project, where I was initially hired as an IT consultant and later appointed to the CTO role, I built and led a team to develop software, secured funding, and helped shape the technical direction of the company. I introduced Agile methods, Scrum practices, and a user-focused design approach, which enhanced teamwork, accelerated project delivery, and created products that were more intuitive for customers to use.

## Main Responsibilities and Achievements

* __Building and Leading the Team__: Built a skilled software development team from scratch and created a collaborative, innovative environment where team members could grow.

* __Adopting Agile Practices__: Introduced Agile and Scrum methods to improve how the team worked, making it easier to manage projects and deliver them on time.

* __Focus on User Experience__: Led efforts to ensure our products were easy to use, which helped us keep customers happy and engaged.

* __Working with Partners__: Collaborated with third-party vendors, including AAB, Malindo, and Shopback, to define integration requirements and ensure seamless connectivity with external systems.

* __Managing Product Development__: Took charge of turning business ideas into clear tasks for the team, ensuring we stayed on track with what the business needed.

* __Mentoring the Team__: Guided and mentored team members, helping them improve their skills and become better developers and leaders.

* __Mobile Application Development__: Developed mobile apps using the Expo framework for scanning ticket validity, ensuring they worked smoothly on both iOS and Android.

* __Cloud Infrastructure & Image Processing__: Set up an image processing service on AWS Lambda, improving website speed by converting images into a faster format.


This role gave me the chance to use my technical skills and leadership experience to help the company grow, improve its products, and deliver value to customers.
