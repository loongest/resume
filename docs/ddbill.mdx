# DDBill International Sdn Bhd

Technical Consultant
March 2016 - September 2018 (2 years 7 months)

As a Technical Consultant at Dinpay / DDBill International, I played a key role in building and leading a global technical team to support customer requests worldwide. My main focus was on training the team and helping them understand how payment gateways work. This knowledge ensured they could effectively assist clients in setting up, troubleshooting, and resolving any issues during the integration process. I also developed systems and strategies to streamline workflows and reduce repetitive tasks, increasing overall team efficiency.


## Additional Achievements and Efforts:

* __Custom WordPress Plugin Development__: I created custom plugins for WordPress to simplify the integration of payment gateways, ensuring secure and seamless transaction processing on clients' websites.

* __Sandbox Testing Tool Development__:  I developed a testing tool using Spring Boot to enable the support team to test and troubleshoot payment gateway systems, which helped reduce errors and sped up the troubleshooting process.

In this role, I combined my technical expertise and leadership to improve the team's efficiency and provide excellent support to clients globally during their payment gateway integration process.
