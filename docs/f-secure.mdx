# F-Secure

November 2007 - June 2014 (6 years 8 months)

As a software engineer at F-Secure, I contributed to various aspects of the company’s technology development, including research, project architecture design, and team collaboration. I was involved in creating and improving software systems, ensuring smooth workflows, and helping teams deliver high-quality products.

## Key Responsibilities:
* __Technology Research & Design__: Whenever a new project started, we had the opportunity, supported by the company, to conduct research and explore new technologies. I was involved in these efforts and participated in designing the architecture of software projects.

* __Project Refactoring__: Addressed the challenge of refactoring based on the Liferay framework within an umbrella structure across multiple teams. Due to a lack of communication, each team introduced redundant resources, leading to slow response times. As a member of the ASG team, I was involved in improving and integrating the company’s internal projects, enhancing their efficiency. While this may seem straightforward, those familiar with Liferay development will understand the significant challenges involved.

* __Sprint Planning__: This is an area where I learned from the company culture to become self-disciplined and set clear goals. I collaborated with team members and the Scrum Master to estimate tasks using planning poker and committed to delivering specific work items within the sprint.

* __Feature Estimation__: Midway through each sprint, I collaborated with product owners to review and estimate upcoming features. This process ensured that we had a clear understanding of the workflows, user interface (UI) requirements, and any dependencies involved. By doing so, we could better plan and prioritize our tasks, making sure that everything aligned with the project's goals and timelines.

* __Daily Stand-ups__: Participated in brief daily meetings (15 minutes) to share what was completed, any issues, and what would be worked on next.

* __Bug Review__: Conducted bug reviews three times a week to to keep the number of bugs under control and ensure that issues were addressed promptly. This regular check-in helped us identify and fix problems quickly, maintaining the quality and stability of our software. By staying on top of bugs, we could focus more on developing new features and improving the overall user experience.


## Skills & Experiences Gained

* __Design Patterns__: Learned and applied proven solutions to common software design problems to improve code structure and readability.

* __Architecture Design__: Contributed to the overall structure of software systems to ensure they were scalable and maintainable.
